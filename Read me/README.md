To do:
- Add all skills
    - Figure out how to store activities with two skill reqs
- Add gear slots (start with normal everything)
    - Later add qualities
    - Add potion/food efficiency boosts?
- Add warning when selecting activity that you can do yet

Ideas:
- Add interactive world map
- Add expected drops for activities

# Consideration for future issues
- number of achievement points is needed for Omni-Tool
- Location of activity is needed for bonus of certain region attributes
- number of Adventure Tools worn is important for attributes of these items
- "Chance to Find Adventurers' Guild Token" attribute important for expected loot
