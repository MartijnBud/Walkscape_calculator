# Still to do:
- [ ] Add more tool slots (and unlock them based on character lvl?)
- [ ] Change quality of tools
- [ ] Discount activity table with gear + lvl bonus
- [ ] Add food
- [ ] Add conditionals for e.g. 'when wearing x of gear y'
- [ ] Add expected outcome of activities
- [ ] Maybe instead of table, 2 options, one to calculate the most efficient activity and the other to see full table?
